## Alpha Readability Calculator (ARC) 1.0

Hi all,

Happy to release our new app, Alpha Readability Calculator (ARC) 1.0. The ARC is a wrapper of the Python package "readability" (https://pypi.org/project/readability/), which helps calculate nine readability indices as well as 29 measures at lexical and syntactic levels. Our special thanks go to the developers of "readability".

The ARC is designed and developed by Dr. Lei Lei, Professor in Applied Linguistics, Shanghai International Studies University. The ARC provides versions working on both MS Windows and Mac OS. It is free to use the ARC, but you may need to cite the Python package "readability" when you use it in your research. We would very much appreciate it if you also kindly cite the ARC and our works such as Wen and Lei (2022) and Lei and Yan (2016).

## Guidelines for Users

1. Put all the texts you are going to process in a folder (such as "my_test_files", the test folder that we provide and that contains five abstracts of our articles). Note that all texts should be in the .txt format with the encoding 'UTF-8'. 

2. Open Alpha Readability Calculator. 

3. Click "Choose your folder" to select the folder (such as the folder "my_test_files"). The ARC will show the address of the folder that you chose. 

4. Click "Calculate". When the ARC says "Processing ends", find the newly generated file entitled "00ARC_Results_readability.csv" in your chosen folder (such as the folder "my_test_files"). The file contains the results. Open it with your spreadsheet app such as MS Office Excel or Numbers on Mac OS and check out the readability measures of all texts in the folder.
